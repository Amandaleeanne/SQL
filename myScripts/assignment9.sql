Create and call a stored procedure named insert_category_sp. In the stored
procedure, a new row is added to the Categories table. To do that, this procedure
should have one parameter for the category name.
Code two CALL statements that test this procedure. Note that this table doesnâ€™t
allow duplicate category names.
The second call should try to add the same value for category name. Verify the 2nd
call results in an error.

/*

	Write at least a few sentences on what you feel are the main learning points in this assignment?
		The main learning points of this assignment is to further understand error handling and how to use "noSQL" in SQL. Aka, expanding
        on the knowlege of last week of how you can write "regular code" within a SQL script to handle databases, this time using both SFUNC, SPROC, and perameters.
        I also think you wanted to showcase the difference between SPROC's and SFUNC's and thier individal use cases.
	Write at least a  few sentences on, what this assignment covered/what you feel you learned, that could be relevant for doing the Final Group Project:
    I feel like I didn't learn anything too new, at least in terms of programming, other than the difference between functions and procedures and what the syntax for perameters are. 
    For my final project I might end up using functions more often than procedures, such as for calcualtions,
	because procedures tend to lean more twords "wrting" to a database and fucntions are more of a "read only", at least as showcased here.
    Since the final project is only reading the database, from what I can tell, I belive using functions for things you find doing a lot would
    be benificial.
